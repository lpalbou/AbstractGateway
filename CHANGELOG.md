and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.9] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- Gateway discovery now advertises `/api/gateway/audio/transcriptions/models` for STT catalog lookup.
- Added local and proxied STT model catalog responses backed by AbstractCore/AbstractVoice.

### Fixed
- Gateway capability catalogs now map Gateway-scoped voice and vision env vars into the embedded capability registry, so local Gateway deployments expose configured voice/TTS/STT/image models without requiring duplicate lower-level env names.
- Catalog proxy calls now omit unset optional query params instead of forwarding `None` values.

### Changed
- Raised dependency floors to Runtime `>=0.4.10`, Core `>=2.13.13`, Flow `>=0.3.10`, and Voice `>=0.9.3`.

## [0.2.8] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- Capability discovery now advertises
  `capabilities.contracts.common.runs.input_data` and
  `capabilities.contracts.common.runs.history_bundle` so thin clients can
  feature-detect the run input and RunHistoryBundle endpoints from the shared
  Gateway contract.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-05-10

### Updated

- Bumped abstractagent floor to >=0.3.6 to match the new abstractagent release that requires abstractruntime>=0.4.9.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- Raised the AbstractVision floor to `abstractvision>=0.3.4` across Gateway
  install profiles so `abstractgateway[gpu]` and the NVIDIA image inherit the
  stable-diffusion.cpp binding constraint that avoids the broken
  `stable-diffusion-cpp-python==0.4.6` Linux sdist.
- Updated release-facing Docker examples and package metadata from `0.2.5` to
  `0.2.6`.
- Release/CI installs now bypass the restored pip dependency cache for editable
  dependency resolution, avoiding stale package indexes immediately after
  lower-package releases.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-05-09

### Changed

- Promoted the base `abstractgateway` install to the remote-light HTTP/SSE
  server profile. It now includes Runtime multimodal support, AbstractAgent,
  AbstractCore remote/media/tools/tokens/compression/vision/voice/audio,
  AbstractVision, AbstractVoice, AbstractFlow compatibility,
  AbstractMemory/LanceDB KG support, FastAPI, multipart uploads, and Uvicorn.
- Raised Runtime and Agent floors to `AbstractRuntime>=0.4.9` and
  `abstractagent>=0.3.6`.
- Simplified install guidance around `abstractgateway`, `abstractgateway[apple]`,
  and `abstractgateway[gpu]`. The older `http`, `server`, `multimodal`,
  `memory`, `voice`, `vision`, `all`, and `server-nvidia` extras remain as
  compatibility aliases.
- The NVIDIA Docker image now installs `abstractgateway[gpu]`; `server-nvidia`
  remains only as a compatibility alias.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- Explicit install profiles for the Gateway package: minimal base,
  `http`, `multimodal`, `server`, `memory`, `apple`, `gpu`, `all-apple`,
  `all-gpu`, and `server-nvidia`.
- `abstractgateway-config` plus `abstractgateway config` for operator status and
  private `.env` bootstrap without taking ownership of AbstractCore provider
  configuration.
- Gateway memory store resolver for AbstractMemory-backed LanceDB, SQLite, and
  in-memory stores, including `/kg/query` store metadata.
- Core catalog proxy endpoints for thin clients:
  `GET /api/gateway/voice/voices`,
  `GET /api/gateway/audio/speech/models`, and
  `GET /api/gateway/vision/provider_models`.
- Added a `server-nvidia` extra plus an experimental CUDA/PyTorch-based
  `abstractgateway-server-nvidia` Docker image recipe for full NVIDIA machines.
- Release and manual GHCR image workflows now publish the light default server
  image and attempt an experimental best-effort NVIDIA full image.

### Changed

- Base installs are now intentionally minimal again:
  `AbstractRuntime>=0.4.8` only.
- Server and multimodal profiles now use the aligned Runtime/Core/Voice/Vision
  floors: `AbstractRuntime>=0.4.8`, `abstractcore>=2.13.12`,
  `abstractvision>=0.3.3`, and `abstractvoice>=0.9.2`.
- Server, native Apple, native GPU, and NVIDIA profiles now require
  `abstractagent>=0.3.5`, so Gateway-hosted agent nodes resolve against the
  same Core/Runtime baseline as Gateway itself.
- Release tests now reset Gateway's process-global service between cases and
  pass explicit provider/model overrides for ledger summary/chat generation
  tests.
- Native Python hardware profiles are full deployment aggregates:
  `abstractgateway[apple]` and `abstractgateway[all-apple]` install the
  Apple-local stack and all relevant non-NVIDIA framework capabilities, while
  `abstractgateway[gpu]` and `abstractgateway[all-gpu]` install the matching
  local GPU stack.
- Gateway-owned runtime handoff now seeds `_runtime.prompt_cache`,
  `_runtime.max_attachment_bytes`, and `_runtime.workflow_bundles_dir` from
  Gateway configuration.
- Gateway LLM helper defaults now resolve through the same deployment cascade as
  runtime execution instead of hardcoded local model fallbacks.
- Docker Compose local builds can override `ABSTRACTGATEWAY_EXTRAS`; the
  default examples use port `8080`, and an NVIDIA compose overlay is available
  for GPU hosts.
- The default Docker server image now composes `abstractgateway[server,memory]`
  so KG workflows and `/kg/query` have the AbstractMemory/LanceDB store package
  available without making memory a base-package dependency.
- The `memory` profile now depends on `AbstractMemory[lancedb]>=0.2.6`.

### Fixed

- `memory_kg_*` effects and `/kg/query` no longer assume LanceDB directly;
  in-memory stores work, SQLite structured queries work when the installed
  AbstractMemory build exposes `SQLiteTripleStore`, and semantic queries fail
  clearly when the selected store has no vector/search capability.
- Dynamic voice/audio/vision catalog discovery now delegates to the AbstractCore
  server catalog boundary when configured, with bounded static fallback when it
  is not.
- Observer/chat/backlog/discovery helpers now return a clear provider/model
  configuration error when no request, Gateway env, or AbstractCore default is
  available.

### Notes

- The default Docker image remains the release-grade light, portable image for
  `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. The NVIDIA image is `linux/amd64` only and
  is experimental/best-effort because vLLM/Torch/Diffusers dependency
  resolution is much heavier than the default server profile and still needs a
  CUDA host smoke gate before production positioning.
- There is no practical MLX Docker image target for Apple Silicon today: MLX
  depends on Apple's Metal stack and Docker Desktop runs Linux containers
  without Metal/MPS device access. Apple local inference should stay native on
  macOS, not containerized; the Gateway container can point at Docker Model
  Runner, native LM Studio, `mlx_lm.server`, or Ollama OpenAI-compatible
  endpoints via `model-runner.docker.internal` or `host.docker.internal`.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- Versioned thin-client capability contracts for Gateway common features, AbstractFlow editor/runtime support, AbstractAssistant media/cache controls, and AbstractCode-facing prompt-cache controls.
- AbstractFlow gateway-first editor contract validation, including VisualFlow CRUD/publish/start/observe coverage and a bundled flow input-schema endpoint.
- Gateway-owned session prompt-cache lifecycle routes:
  - `GET /api/gateway/sessions/{session_id}/prompt_cache/status`
  - `POST /api/gateway/sessions/{session_id}/prompt_cache/prepare`
  - `POST /api/gateway/sessions/{session_id}/prompt_cache/rebuild`
  - `POST /api/gateway/sessions/{session_id}/prompt_cache/clear`
- Generated-media contract fields in capability discovery, including direct-vs-workflow generated-image availability.
- Direct generated-image route, `POST /api/gateway/runs/{run_id}/images/generate`, backed by Runtime/Core image output selectors, artifact storage, and `abstract.media.image.generated` ledger events.
- Backlog completion ledger for the capability contract, Flow editor contract, session prompt-cache lifecycle, and generated-media gateway contract.

### Changed

- Capability discovery now truthfully reports provider-level and session-level prompt-cache controls, plus direct Gateway voice/audio/image endpoints where configured.
- API, configuration, deployment, Docker, README, FAQ, and LLM ingestion docs now describe generated images as both workflow-backed and directly available through the Gateway route when a Runtime/Core image backend is installed and configured.
- Docker/Compose release examples now point at the `0.2.3` server image.

### Fixed

- Fixed stale release-facing docs that said Gateway had no direct image-generation endpoint after the direct route landed.
- Fixed an order-dependent test import leak so the full local pytest suite can run cleanly after the AbstractFlow editor contract tests.

### Notes

- Direct image generation still depends on a configured Runtime/Core/AbstractVision-compatible backend; Gateway does not bundle heavy local image engines.
- Session prompt-cache lifecycle is Gateway-owned naming and orchestration over provider/model controls. It is not a provider-independent local KV cache or full CachedSession persistence system.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- MkDocs Material configuration for the documentation site.
- CI docs build job and release docs gate.
- Release workflow deployment to GitHub Pages via `mkdocs gh-deploy`.
- PyPI-backed GHCR server image publishing for `ghcr.io/lpalbou/abstractgateway-server`.
- CI validation build for the local server Docker image recipe.
- Docker server image, Compose profile, and deployment documentation.
- `docs`, `server`, `vision`, and `multimodal` optional dependency extras.
- Discovery metadata for AbstractCore capability plugins (`voice`, `audio`, `vision`, and future `music`).

### Changed

- Version metadata aligned across `pyproject.toml`, package `__version__`, and FastAPI app metadata.
- The server install profile now mirrors the newer AbstractRuntime/Core multimodal stack: `AbstractRuntime[multimodal]>=0.4.6`, `abstractcore[remote,media,tools,tokens,compression,vision,voice,audio]>=2.13.10`, `abstractvision>=0.3.1`, and `abstractvoice>=0.9.0`.
- The server Docker/Compose profile now documents workflow-backed image generation through AbstractVision, direct Gateway TTS/STT through AbstractVoice, and provider-dependent prompt-cache controls.
- Gateway voice/audio endpoints now accept AbstractVoice's newer local/remote backend environment knobs in addition to the existing Gateway-scoped settings.

### Notes

- Release scope is intentionally explicit: TTS and STT have direct Gateway endpoints; generated images are available through Runtime/Core workflows with AbstractVision installed and configured, but Gateway does not yet expose a direct image-generation HTTP endpoint.
- Prompt-cache support is provider-level control-plane support. This release does not add a Gateway-owned CachedSession lifecycle API.
- `flows/bundles/article@dev.flow` was inspected and left untracked. It is a local `dev` bundle generated by the Gateway publisher, not a release artifact.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-09

### Changed

- Dependency bumps (see `pyproject.toml`):
  - `AbstractRuntime>=0.4.2` (and `AbstractRuntime[abstractcore]>=0.4.2` for HTTP/voice/telegram/all extras)
  - `abstractagent>=0.3.1`, `abstractvoice>=0.6.3`, `abstractflow>=0.3.7`
  - `abstractcore[media,tools]>=2.11.8` (via `abstractgateway[all]`)
- Documentation refresh for external users:
  - added explicit AbstractFramework ecosystem context
  - updated minimum versions in install snippets to match `pyproject.toml`
  - kept the architecture diagram as the canonical “shape of the system”
- Version metadata alignment:
  - `pyproject.toml`, `src/abstractgateway/__init__.py`, and `src/abstractgateway/app.py` now agree on `0.2.1`

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-04

### Changed

- Documentation refresh for external users:
  - new FAQ (`docs/faq.md`)
  - clarified quickstart + smoke checks in `README.md`
  - tightened getting started, configuration, security, and API overview docs
  - improved cross-linking in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `SECURITY.md`
  - refreshed `llms.txt` / `llms-full.txt` for agent ingestion (index + full snapshot)
- Version bump to reflect the documentation release (`0.1.0` → `0.1.1`).

### Notes

- No intentional runtime behavior changes in this release; it is documentation-focused.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-03

### Added

- Initial public package for AbstractGateway (`abstractgateway`).
