Instead, use GitHub’s **private vulnerability reporting** / **Security Advisories** for this repository:

If you cannot use GitHub advisories, contact the maintainers privately (e.g. via GitHub profile contact links).

- a clear description of the issue and impact

## Coordinated disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will work with you to:
- confirm the issue
- assess severity and affected versions

Please avoid active exploitation, privacy violations, or destructive testing.
