//! THE WIDTH POLICY — measure first, truncate only under real pressure.
//!
//! Shared verbatim with the AbstractCore console-TUI
//! (`console-tui/src/ui/widths.rs` there): this console is the reference
//! surface, and a column that reads one way here and another way on its
//! sibling is a drift bug waiting to be filed twice. Both copies —
//! module, policy and tests — must stay byte-identical below this header.
//!
//! ## The defect this replaces
//!
//! Both routes screens sized their grid from CONSTANTS — `Cells(28)` for
//! the route key, `Cells(20)` for the source, plus a pre-render
//! `ellipsize(model, 40)` — and handed the leftover to a `Flex` model
//! column. On a 200-cell terminal that printed
//! `AbstractFramework/wan2.2-t2v-a14b-diffu…` beside seventy blank cells:
//! the payload was cut to a constant while the space to carry it whole sat
//! unused one column over. Worse, the cut fell at the HEAD-preserving end,
//! so `…t2v-a14b-diffusers-8bit` and `…i2v-a14b-diffusers-8bit` printed as
//! the same string and the column stopped telling its rows apart.
//!
//! ## The policy
//!
//! 1. **Measure.** A column's natural width is the widest thing it must
//!    say — every cell in the column plus its own header title.
//! 2. **Fit when it fits.** If the naturals tile inside the budget, every
//!    column gets its natural width and NOTHING is truncated. Leftover
//!    cells stay blank at the right edge; blank space is not a defect,
//!    a lie about a model name is.
//! 3. **Shrink proportionally under pressure.** Over budget, columns give
//!    up cells in proportion to the slack they actually have
//!    (`natural - min`), so no column collapses to a stub while its
//!    neighbours stay fat. Payload columns are protected by a generous
//!    `min`, never by a special case.
//! 4. **Keep the tail on identifiers.** Model names, route keys, source
//!    modules and provider ids differ in their LAST segment. Those columns
//!    truncate in the middle ([`middle_fit`]); prose columns keep the head.
//! 5. **Cut once.** The engine's `Table` truncates any cell wider than its
//!    column, head-first, with no say in the matter — so cells are fitted
//!    HERE, to the width solved here, and the engine's own cut becomes a
//!    no-op it never reaches.
